#Feed The Fish
Feed The Fish is a simple, charming Minecraft mod that lets you feed fish with bread! Right-click on water with bread to throw "Fish Food" onto the surface. Nearby fish will swim over, eat it, and show happy particles with a satisfying sound.
Perfect for making oceans and rivers feel more alive and interactive.

Features

Throw bread onto water to create floating "Fish Food".
Fish (cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish) swim naturally toward the food.
When a fish eats it, they get a small heal, happy villager particles appear, and you hear an eating sound.
Optimized for performance – works smoothly even with large schools of fish.
No configuration needed – just install and play!
